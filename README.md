# mros_reasoner

A meta-controller implementation for ROS2 foxy

### Note:

**This branch is highly experimental and unstable**

## Installation

### Previous steps

#### Install java jre

The `mros_reasoner` uses  [Owlready2](https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to handle the ontologies and perform reasoning.

Owlready2 by default uses the [HermiT reasoner](http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) which is written in Java, and thus you need a Java Vitual Machine to perform reasoning in Owlready2.

You can use this command **To install the Java Vitual Machine**

```console
sudo apt-get install openjdk-14-jre
```

Under Linux, Owlready should automatically find Java.

### Create reasoner_ws - ROS2  Foxy

- We recommend you to create a workspace only for `mros_reasoner`, for example:

```console
  mkdir -p ~/mros_reasoner_ws/src
  cd mros_reasoner_ws
```

### Get mros2_reasoner - ROS2  Foxy

- You need to clone the `mc_mros_reasoner` into the reasoner workspace (ie: `mros_reasoner_ws`).
- Make sure to change to the branch `foxy_devel`

```console
  cd ~/mros_reasoner_ws/src
  git clone --branch foxy_devel https://github.com/tud-cor/mc_mros_reasoner.git
```
### Get the Pilot URJC components - ROS2  Foxy

- To test the code, get the Turtlebot3 Pilot from https://github.com/MROS-RobMoSys-ITP/Pilot-URJC
- **Make sure you check the** metacontrol-test-integration **branch**
- Put the packages in the same ws (i.e. `~/mros_reasoner_ws/`)
- Follow the instructions on how to build the packages there


### Build the code - ROS2  Foxy

- Once you have the workspace setup, you can build the workspace
- Do not forget to source ROS foxy workspace before building your `mros_reasoner_ws`

```console
cd ~/mros_reasoner_ws/src
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## Execution - ROS2  Foxy - with simulated turtlebot3


1. **Launch turtlebot3 world in gazebo sim**

    ```console
      export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:[ros2_ws]/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
      export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
      ros2 launch pilot_urjc_bringup tb3_sim_launch.py
    ```
  - After the last command, the Gazebo simulator is running in background. Don't worry if no window is opened.
  
2. **Turtlebot3 Navigation launcher**

    This launcher includes rviz, nav2, amcl, map-server, **[system-modes](https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes)**, etc.
    The **system_modes mode_manager** takes the modes description from `params/pilot_modes.yaml`.


    ```console
      export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
      ros2 launch pilot_urjc_bringup nav2_turtlebot3_launch.py
    ```
  - RVIz opens, and the navigation system is waiting for the activation of the laser_driver. It is not necessary to set an initial robot position with the 2D Pose Estimate tool. When the laser_driver is up, the pose will be set automatically.


3. **Launch the mros2 metacontroller**

    This step launches the `mros2_metacontroller`, it launches by default the `kb.owl` ontology and connects to the
    system_modes created by the pilot_urjc
    - The names of the modes there have been changed to match the `fd` names of the `kb.owl` ontology.


    ```console
      ros2 launch mros2_reasoner launch_reasoner.launch.py
    ```

By default it sets the `f3_v3_r1` mode which corresponds to the NORMAL mode.

With all the above, we will have enough to test some navigation actions and experiment changing the current mode and seeing how this change affects the navigation.


4. **Publish energy values**

- To get a reconfiguration, we need to Publish some fake qa_values. This node sends a [`DiagnosticArray`](http://docs.ros.org/api/diagnostic_msgs/html/msg/DiagnosticArray.html) message, with increasing energy value.


    ```console
      ros2 run mros2_reasoner mros2_publish_qa_node
    ```



### Testing  - **Does not work on ROS2**

Two [rostest](http://wiki.ros.org/rostest) have been created for this package:

1. The **1-level functional architecture** test, which checks that the reasoner is capable of loading an `owl` file compliant with TOMAsys including:

    1. a Function and multiple FDs that solves it.
    1. QA performance values for the FDs.

    To run this first test use:

    ```console
    source mros1_reasoner_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rostest mros1_reasoner test_level_1_functional_arch.test
    ```

1. The **QA reception** test, checks wheter or not the reasoner can correctly receive a QA value and update it on its knowledge base.

    To run this second test use:

    ```console
    source mros1_reasoner_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rostest mros1_reasoner test_qa_reception.test
    ```
